 Touch
 the
 screen



 The 
 past 
 year 
 of isolation 
 and 
 increased 
 reliance 
 on digital 
 connectivity 
 has 
 twisted 
 my sense 
 of time 
 and space. 


 In some ways, 
 these 
 technologies 
 and our 
 confined 
 states
 of being
 have 
 increased 
 my access 
 to what 
 I have been 
 geographically 
 distant from, 
 which 
 I fear 
 may be 
 lost 
 as we 
 re-engage 
 with our 
 in-person 
 connections. 


 This 
 virtual 
 closeness 
 also 
 hightlights 
 our distance; 
 being 
 apart 
 through 
 the screen. 


 We 
 remain 
 apart 
 so we 
 may not 
 behave 
 as vectors, 
 carriers 
 of a 
 biological 
 entity 
 that 
 lacks 
 illusions 
 of autonomy.
 
 
 We 
 are 
 not 
 just 
 interconnected 
 but 
 entangled.
