Touch
the

The
body
is the
database
of 
lived 
experience.


Each
gesture
each 
action
leaves
a trace
in the 
cellular
make-up 
of being.

Each 
pulse,
each 
tension
of a
muscle
fiber,
each
hormonal
release,
each
neural
flash,
each
biological
action
and
reaction
leaves 
a
mark, 
an
imprint.


The
colors
of the
rectangles
change
in correlation
with my
heart rate
data
collected
on a 
day 
selected
randomly
from 
the first
period of 
quarantine
in 2020.


Ireland
had
the longest
COVID-19
lockdown
of any
European
nation.


The colors
of the
circles
change
in correlation
with the
movements of
your
mouse 
or finger
across
the screen.


Please
stay
for 
a while.








The 
button 
is here 
for 
when 
you 
are 
ready 
to go.
