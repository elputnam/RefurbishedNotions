# Refurbished Notions

## Glib Drive

The body is the database of lived experience. Each gesture each action leaves a trace in the cellular make-up of being.Each pulse, each tension of a muscle fiber, each hormonal release, each neural flash, each biological action and reaction leaves a mark, an imprint.

The colors of the rectangles change in correlation with my heart rate data collected on a day selected randomly from the first period of quarantine in 2020. 

## Tether

The past period of isolation and increased reliance on digital connectivity has twisted my sense of time and space. 

In some ways, these technologies and our confined states of being have increased my access to what I have been geographically distant from, which I fear may be lost as we re-engage with our in-person connections. This virtual closeness also hightlights our distance; being apart through the screen. We remain apart so we may not behave as vectors, carriers of a biological entity that lacks illusions of autonomy. 

We are not just interconnected but entangled.

## Firefly Burnout

The grinding persistence of the pandemic has also brought sensations of general exhaustion: enduring tiredness that never seems to abate with sleep, and signs of burnout as responsibilities mount, lulling body and soul into a state of lethargy. Artist Amelia Winger-Bearskin created a banner for the #2020 Awakening Project in the US that states: “What is made bright by the loss of your light?” [2] This statement, made in solidarity with mothers and female-identifying carers, encapsulates the ongoing grind of this pandemic, the disruption of care networks, and the isolation of the family during this period so well. I have spent much of the past year persistently trying to balance familial responsibilities with my job, research, and creative work, though in August 2021, when I created the Firefly Burnout sketch, I found myself in an unwavering state of lethargy, digging deep within my being to draw up the energy to keep going. Angst gives way to exhaustion.

## Indeterminate System

I recall from the early days of the pandemic, people sharing on Twitter and other social media platforms about the potentials for productivity during the time of lockdown and social isolation. At that stage, the psychological grind of constricted life had yet to impact people whose lives had been marked with a privilege of movement. In some ways I was reminded of the post-partum period, when my capacities to do anything were tied to an unpredictable schedule determined by my infant daughter’s bodily needs.

## Oblivious Network

The Oxford English Dictionary defines to sketch as:

1. To describe briefly, generally, or in outline; to give the essential facts or points of, without going into details; to outline. 2. To draw the outline or prominent features of (a picture, figure, etc.), esp. as preliminary or preparatory to further development; to make a sketch or rough draught of (something); to draw or paint in this manner. 3. a. intransitive or absol. To practise sketching; to draw or paint sketches. b. To proceed in a sketchy manner.

Sketching is useful for working out ideas, to bring a concept into being through gestural form. Sketching is a practice that enables the development of skills, but also the capacity to escape the isolation of mental confines as some thing takes on sensorial qualities as shared phenomenon. Treated as a rough process at the early stages of creative production, sketching can initiate a process of crystallisation – a germ instigating a physical reaction. The manifestation of the sketch can vary: pencil drawing, jotted notes, sonic hum, or even a few lines of computer code. What matters is the emphasis that is placed on action – on the act of doing. Shifting attention from a final output, sketching functions as a practice of maintenance.

## Delicate Figure

I steal moments of time between other duties, meaning that such activities take on a piecemeal quality. I am turning to more minor creative acts, which function as maintenance. Bits that accumulate, but lack over-arching consistency or planning. Such activities draw me into the present, with a focus on the act of making. Little, if any, investment is placed on the output, but instead they are attempts to foster a little joy at the ability to communicate something I cannot quite articulate. They also function as ways of marking time, drawing my attention to the moment; affective encounters with a medium that instigate potential aesthetic encounters with others. These involve care of the self. In contrast to a flourishing self-care industry that promises betterment through acts of consumption, this turning to minor gestures of artistic and creative making enable an engagement with the subtle joy and wonder at material transformation.

## Viral Time

In the creative coding book *Aesthetic Programming,* authors Winnie Soon and Geoff Cox present an exercise that asks students to animate a "throbber," that virtual indicator of operations in process.  

It is a measure of time, but without a sense of progress; just a cycle that may end at any moment (if at all). 

It got me thinking about time as experienced during the pandemic. 

Time has taken on a different feel.

## Ferocious Patience

Once it became clear that working from home would extend into the new academic year, I noticed that my running sessions decreased, as I was no longer able to make time for them due to the demands of online teaching. What had became a significant means of coping with the unknown at this time--my runs became longer and longer as the months progressed and our circles of movement increased--suddenly had to give way to the demands of productivity affiliated with my job as a university lecturer. Sometimes after lecturing online for several hours, I noticed that my FitBit stated I reached my step goals, despite the fact I remained put in my chair. My gesticulations combined with my swivel chair movements were enough for the accelerometer to calculate the motions. One time when I gave a conference paper virtually, my racing heart rate was tracked as exercise for that day. 

The FitBit categorizes activity minutes as lightly active, moderately active, very active, and sedentary. Categories that are interpreted through heart rate data and movements. My very active minutes became my sedentary minutes, as I fed the machine. Becoming machine. Became the machine.

## Sedentary Productivity

This period of staying close to home -- initially within a 2 kilometer radius -- got me thinking about movement within this sphere, and how my body responded to this constraint. Circling around the house repeatedly, following my two young daughters. I wanted to start counting these steps. I tried to make a pedometer with an Adafruit circuit playground (in order to maintain control over my data), though I was unable to find a way to log the data externally and it kept shutting down due to a battery fault. I ended up just purchasing a FitBit. The model I acquired could also track heart rate. What began as an artistic impetus -- a desire to track my steps and biometric data as a means of documenting this experience -- soon came to influence my running. I found myself running further and faster, making sure to hit my step targets. I set an alert for every hour, so if I had not completed 250 per hours I would be prompted to do so. For a while, I just marched in place to meet these arbitrary targets. My bodily movements were modified in relation to this technical object, a digital device that tracked my movements.

I also noted its inaccuracies. Sometimes while driving for prolonged periods of time, steps would accumulate. If I received an hourly alert, I found I could swing my arm while behind the steering wheel, these movements counted as steps as the car's acceleration combined with my arm's motions were read as such by the accelerometer. 

## Brash phone

In March 2020, I began running again. At that stage, it had been years since I ran regularly. I used to run track and field in high school, but it did not become a lifelong habit. During this first period of lockdown in response to COVID-19, when schools and creches were closed and we were confined to our home, I discovered was running was the only time during the day that I was uninterrupted and alone. It became the only time I was able to think. As my field hit the pavement in a rhythmic pattern and fuelled by endorphines, I let me my mind wander, crafting webs of ideas. When I got back home, I would jot down everything I could recall, though like a dream, some thoughts were inevitably lost with my exhaled breaths and sweat. Running also helped my psychological state and became a way to process the ongoing stress of the pandemic through my body.

The data collected by the FitBit is data of the body; indications and tracking of the body's movements, heartrates, sleep states, and so forth. The device quantifies gestures (both internal and external), creating a lingustic or numeric trace that is read and tracked. It is not only data of the body, but a body of data.

## Android Dream

Since becoming a mother, I have struggled with sleep deprivation. Lack of sleep has a profound impact, physically and mentally, including an ongoing state of general fatigue and sensation of being ground down amidst the pressures affiliated with maternal responsibilities.

*Android Dream* is a generative animation where the image changes, colours schemes and opacity, and the soundtrack are created based on a month’s worth of sleep data collected by my Fitbit. A month is selected randomly from the present back to April 2020, when the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent public health restrictions were becoming manifest in the body. The photographic images and colours change in relation to the sleep level (awake, light, deep, and REM), with the opacities mapped to the duration of sleep at that level. The sound frequencies relate to level of sleep and the volume corresponding to the duration. This work is not just visualisations and sonifications of data, but functions as a performance documentation; a divergent means of presenting the combined pressures of sleep deprivation and maternal responsibilities during the pandemic.
